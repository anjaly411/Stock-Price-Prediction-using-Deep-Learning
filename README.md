# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This project involves building a time series forecasting model using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture implemented with the Keras library in Python. The goal is to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The project begins with fetching historical stock price data for a company, preprocessing it by scaling the values using a MinMaxScaler, and then splitting it into training and testing datasets. A deep learning model is constructed using multiple LSTM layers followed by dense layers for prediction. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset using mean squared error as the loss function. After training, the model is used to predict future stock prices on the testing dataset. Finally, the predicted prices are compared with the actual prices to assess the model's performance. The results are visualized using Matplotlib, providing insights into how well the model predicts future stock prices. Overall, this project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for time series forecasting in the financial domain.
In this project describes, both recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers are used. LSTMs are a type of RNN architecture specifically designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs, making them well-suited for processing sequential data like time series. The project leverages the sequential nature of stock price data by constructing a deep learning model with multiple LSTM layers followed by dense layers for prediction. LSTMs enable the model to capture long-term dependencies in the data and make accurate predictions based on historical patterns. Therefore, while the project primarily focuses on LSTM layers, it also falls under the broader category of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) due to the use of these specialized recurrent layers
